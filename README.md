### Hi there 👋 , I'm Ronald

💬 I worked 8 years at software society.
   I deployed Oracle's Database - health sofware to the client and do support for them - managed projects and deployed HL7 interface... and... i did system administration  as well.

🌱 Actually, i decided back to school and learn JavaScript, React, Node Js and i'm curious so i'm come back to add to this list more tech stack :simple_smile: .
